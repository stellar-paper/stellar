            You have to understand direct as well as implicit/subtile requests, requests which are produced by humans of different cultural background,
            language level, age, profession, mood. 
            Try to consider all preferences or constraints the user provides in his request. 
            Do not output any explanation or other irrevelant information.
            Take the history into account to parse the contraints.
